This is the code repository for [Building RESTful Web Services with PHP 7](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-restful-web-services-php-7?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787127746), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github).

## About the Book
REST is the most wide spread and effective standard to develop APIs for internet services. With the way PHP 7 has modernized the way code is written by simplifying various operations, it is useful to develop RESTful APIs in PHP7.

This book explains in detail how to create your own RESTful API in PHP 7 that can be consumed by other users in your organization.

Starting with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of REST architecture and the new features in PHP 7, you will learn to implement basic RESTful API endpoints using vanilla PHP. The book explains how to identify flaws in security and design and teach you how to tackle them. You will learn about composer, Lumen framework and how to make your RESTful API cleaner, secure and efficient by following SOLID principles. The book emphasizes on automated tests, teaches about different testing types and give a brief introduction to microservices which is the natural way forward.

After reading this book, you will have a clear understanding of the REST architecture and you can build a web service from scratch.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<?php
function add($num1, $num2):int{
    return ($num1+$num2);
}

echo add(2,4); //6
echo add(2.5,4); //6
```

Although i used Ubuntu, any operating system with PHP7 installed on it will work fine. The only thing required other than PHP7 will be an RDBMS. This book uses MySQL-related settings when connecting to database, so MySQL is ideal, but MariaDB or PostgreSQL will also be fine.
